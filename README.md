Voice Sentiment Analysis System
Project Overview
The Voice Sentiment Analysis System is a machine learning-based project designed to identify emotions conveyed in audio recordings. Using Librosa for audio processing, this tool extracts features from voice data and classifies emotions such as angry, sad, happy, and neutral. This project can be valuable in applications like customer service analysis, social media sentiment monitoring, and mental health assessment, where understanding emotions in voice data is crucial.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<li>
<ul>Emotion Detection: Identifies emotions such as angry, sad, happy, and neutral based on vocal tone and pitch patterns.</ul>
<ul>Audio Feature Extraction: Utilizes Librosa to extract key audio features (e.g., MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast) which are essential for emotion classification.</ul>ul
<ul>Machine Learning Model: Trained on labeled datasets to achieve high accuracy in emotion recognition.<ul>
<ul>Potential Real-Time Analysis: Can be adapted for real-time processing to monitor emotions in live conversations or calls.<ul>
</li>
